## Welcome to my Tableau projects repository! 

Here, you'll find a collection of visualizations that I created while preparing for the Tableau Desktop Specialist certification. 
Each project comes with its own interactive dashboard and local dataset in packaged workbook format (.twbx), along with accompanying images in PNG format.

## Project List:

### Bicycles Dataset 
An interactive dashboard showcasing the company's profit over time, segmented by month, product, and year.

### Multifaceted Impact of COVID-19 
Delving into the effects of COVID-19, this visualization highlights the most affected gender, age group, race, and fatality rate among individuals who tested positive in lab tests.

### Job Market in Erie County
This project explores labor statistics and unemployment rates in Erie County, featuring a trend line predicting employment and unemployment percentages.

These projects were not only a part of my preparation for the Tableau Desktop Specialist certification but also served as an opportunity to delve into data visualization & analysis and each project presented unique challenges and insights.
