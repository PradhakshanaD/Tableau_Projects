## Welcome to my Tableau projects repository! 

Here, you'll find a collection of visualizations that I created while preparing for the Tableau Desktop Specialist certification. 
Each project comes with its own interactive dashboard and local dataset in packaged workbook format (.twbx), along with accompanying images in PNG format.

## Project List:

### Bicycles Dataset 
An interactive dashboard showcasing the company's profit over time, segmented by month, product, and year.

### Job Market in Erie County
This project explores labor statistics and unemployment rates in Erie County, featuring a trend line predicting employment and unemployment percentages.

### Multifaceted Impact of COVID-19 
Delving into the effects of COVID-19, this visualization highlights the most affected gender, age group, race, and fatality rate among individuals who tested positive in lab tests.

### Dog Breeds Analysis
Inspired by the infographic book "Knowledge is Beautiful," this visualization uncovers intriguing insights into dog breeds. I categorized breeds into four groups based on a calculated score, derived by weighting various variables. 
The dataset used was compiled through a combination of web scraping with Beautiful Soup and data from a GitHub page.

As a part of this project, I conducted data scraping, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering to create a comprehensive dataset on dog breeds. The visualization showcases my efforts in deriving meaningful insights from the data and 
presents them in an engaging format.

## Dataset Information
Each project includes its local dataset in the packaged workbook file (.twbx), allowing you to explore the visualizations with the original data. Additionally, image files (.png) associated with the projects are provided for reference.

These projects were not only a part of my preparation for the Tableau Desktop Specialist certification but also served as an opportunity to delve into data visualization & analysis and each project presented unique challenges and insights.

Thank you for visiting my Tableau projects repository. I hope you find these visualizations informative.
