## Welcome to my Tableau projects repository! 

Here, you'll find a collection of visualizations that I created while preparing for the Tableau Desktop Specialist certification. 
Each project comes with its own interactive dashboard and local dataset in packaged workbook format (.twbx), along with accompanying images in PNG format.

## Project List:
These projects were not only a part of my preparation for the Tableau Desktop Specialist certification but also served as an opportunity to delve into data visualization & analysis and each project presented unique challenges and insights.

#### Note
I recognize that the visualizations in my projects are inspired by creators across various platforms such as YouTube and the internet. I attribute these inspirations to their respective creators. Notably, my decision to analyze King County data was influenced by Alex the Analyst.
